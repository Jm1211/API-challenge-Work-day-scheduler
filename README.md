# API-challenge-Work-day-scheduler

## Description

This is a simple day scheduler application to plan out your day! It runs on HTML,CSS and Jquery. For this assignment we were provided with boilerplate for our HTML and CSS. While making this application I learned how to use Jquery and third party API's like Bootstrap and Moment.js.

-It displays the hours of 8AM-5PM. Each time block is color coded to let you know if the hour is in the past(grey),present(red) or future(green). Each time block also has an input field and save button that shares your input to local storage.
